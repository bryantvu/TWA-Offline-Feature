## Introduction

The purpose of this Android project is to demonstrate that it is possible to integrate an In-App Purchase solution in the native layer together with the web content of a Trusted Web Activity.

This is made by possible by using App Linking to redirect from the web content to the native layer.

### Huawei Developer Account
A Huawei Developer Account is needed to access and configure Huawei IAP. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one. Please refer to this [guide](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/help/registerandlogin-0000001052613847).

### AppGallery Configuration
1.  Create an app in AppGallery Connect and configure the app information. For details, please refer to  [Configuring App Information in AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/config-agc-0000001050033072?ha_source=hms1).

2.  Create and configure your products in AppGallery Connect. For details, please refer to  [Configuring Your Products](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/config-product-0000001050033076?ha_source=hms1).
3.  Download the  **agconnect-services.json**  file of your app from AppGallery Connect, and add the file to the app-level directory of the demo.
4. Add the signing certificate and add configurations to the app-level  **build.gradle**  file.
5. Change the package name of the Android project to your desired app package name.

## Demo Flow
